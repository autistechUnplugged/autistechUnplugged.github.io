# Under construction as long as "Under Pressure" remains relevant + simple-and-pure-cv
It hasn't changed. But since both this repositore and the "simple-cv" basically had the same intent, I deleted it and upload its content here while I'm still to build and publish a proper portfolio online. Still gotta update some info and check how it is looking, though, but that's stuff for another day.
<br>
<br>

In the words of the deleted repo:<br>
`a CV in nothing but HTML and CSS, which I NEED TO REVIEW AND UPDATE BTW BUT HEAVEN KNOWS WHEN THAT WILL HAPPEN HERE`

> **Under construction as long as "Under Pressure" remains relevant** <br>
Well, I'm studying Web Development, and I finally had to gather the courage to showcase what I've been learning. 
I'm still gathering them, so the portfolio remains under construction. But I guess making it is a first step.
<br><br>
Used Bootstrap.<br>
PS: Check the video for some fantastic music.

> **Regarding the "under construction"** <br>
To be honest, I liked the way it looks and the idea, so I might just keep it as some sort of "practice" project and build an
portfolio, trying new things (or extending it if I can keep the theme).<br><br>
I'm still very insecure about showcasing what I can build so far, so it will take longer to update it.<br>
(and my GitHub since I'm so conscious about the several changes I make to everything).
