# vonhappatsch.github.io

Well, I'm studying Web Development and I had to finally gather the guts to showcase what I've been learning. 
But I'm still gathering them, so the portfolio remains under construction so far. But I guess making it is a first step, right?

Used Bootstrap.
PS.: Check the video for some cool music.

# Regarding the "under construction"
To be honest, I sort of liked the way it looks and the idea, so I might just keep it as some sort of "practice" project and build an
actual portfolio trying new things (or maybe extend it if I'm capable of keeping the theme while doing so).

I'm still very insecure about showcasing what I can build so far, so I guess it will take some more time until I update it
(and my github since I'm so conscious about the several changes I make to everything).
