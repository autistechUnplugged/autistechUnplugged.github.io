# Under construction as long as "Under Pressure" remains relevant

Well, I'm studying Web Development, and I finally had to gather the courage to showcase what I've been learning. 
I'm still gathering them, so the portfolio remains under construction. But I guess making it is a first step.

Used Bootstrap.
PS: Check the video for some fantastic music.

# Regarding the "under construction"
To be honest, I liked the way it looks and the idea, so I might just keep it as some sort of "practice" project and build an
portfolio, trying new things (or extending it if I can keep the theme).

I'm still very insecure about showcasing what I can build so far, so it will take longer to update it.
(and my GitHub since I'm so conscious about the several changes I make to everything).
